He earned a Master’s degree in music composition at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he went on to earn his PhD with distinction in music composition under the guidance of Morton Feldman, Lejaren Hiller, Leo Smit and Wlodziemiercz Kotonski. Later, Mike received a Master of Library Science degree in music librarianship from the University at Buffalo. In addition to teaching, Mike has published a theoretical treatise, including articles for 20th Century Music: “The Monotonal Relationship Between the Augmented and Diminished Polytonal Pitch Sets” (1995), “Progression of Polytonal Pitch Sets” (1996), and “Symmetrical Polytonality” (2009). He also composed and published “Starburst,” a piece for three vibraphones and marimba, which placed in the Percussive Arts Society Competition Contest. Mike has had works recorded on the Contemporary Record Society (CRS), including “Starburst,” “Trio” for violin, cello and piano, “Io” for flute, clarinet and piano, and “Jonathan Edwards” for organ, with Marie Zak on Organ. He is an honorary member of CRS and has written reviews of music scores and recordings.")
